## Getting Started

Before run the development server, make sure all dependencies are installed and provided .env.local file as .env.example. <br>
To run on the development, use:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run stripe-listen
# or
yarn dev
yarn stripe-listen
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/\*]().

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
